# I used the FOCUS latex beamer for this presentation

# Focus v2.3
A presentation theme for LaTeX Beamer that aims at a clean and minimalist design,
so to minimize distractions and put the focus directly on the content.

This package is available through the [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamertheme-focus) in
most LaTeX distributions such as [MiKTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/miktex) and [TeXLive](https://ctan.org/pkg/texlive).

Requires the packages [appendixnumberbeamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/appendixnumberbeamer),
[fira](https://ctan.org/pkg/fira) and [PGF/TikZ](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf)
to be installed in your LaTeX distribution.

The following people deserve appreciation and acknowledgment for improving the template with
additions and modifications (in alphabetical order):

- Sebastian Friedl
- Benjamin Goldman
